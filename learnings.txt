auto type for automatic type deduction
references are helpful in fore (each) loops so act like normal rather than the elemetn being assigned a new (unrelated to the iterate) variable 
emplace_back() is like push_back() but can pass parameters directly to the constructor e.g. neurons.emplace_back(0, "hi", 4) is the same as neurons.push_back(Neuron(0, "hi", 4)) if neurons has type std::vector<Neuron> but avoids creating a temporary object
cant use cout directly on a vector (duh), iterate through and do manually
when overloading a binary operator, if the overloading is defined in the class on which the overloading is to be performed, the first item is implicitly passed into the method, so only the other item needs to be specified as a parameter.
do not need to dereference a function to call it. e.g. double func* function; func("hi") is fine. explicit dereferencing can be done (*func)("hello") but not necessary
types are inferred in some circumstances i.e. vector<vector<int>> container; container.push_back({{8}, {4}}) is fine - no need to specify the type (although you can)
relu training requires much lower learning rate for reliable training with SGD
relu does not like NAG (parameter space not smooth enough?), but likes Adam.
you can unpack a struct into multiple variables with auto [a, b] = my_struct;
