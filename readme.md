## Learning C++ via the implementation of various NNs.

### HaveDone:
- Implemented a basic multilayer perceptron from scratch (no nn libraries)
    - NeuralNetwork class (contains vector of Layer objects, training methods, and evaluation methods)
    - Layer class (containing weight & bias Matrix objects and inference methods)
    - Matrix class (containing matrix methods e.g. addition, multiplication, transpostition, hadamard...)

- Ability to select activation functions for each layer
- Multithreaded training using stochastic gradient descent
- Ability to save and load model to/from a binary file
- Mnist accuracy incoming 


### Todo:
- implement various training algorithms (Adam, momentum, nesterov momentum etc.)
- implement various regularisation techniques (dropout, cost func penalty for large weights)
- test mnist accuracy
- implement various matrix multiplication optimisations (SIMD instructions, chunked eval, etc.)
- implement various neural network architechtures (LSTMs, RNNs for financial data; CNN for some image data)
